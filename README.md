# Consonance Principle

Code for Omnibus test, Stouffer test, and Fisher combination test for the manuscript "A general consonance principle for closure tests based on p-values" (Under Revision).

This repository contains the main code and R function to calculate the modified procedure which is a consonant procedure. The provided R-code works for the Fisher combination test (up to 10 elementary hypotheses), Stouffer test (up to 10 elementary hypotheses) and Omnibus test with log transformation (up to 6 elementary hypotheses) of the p-values and for significance levels alpha=0.025 or alpha=0.05.

The code to apply the consonance principle can be found in file "code. In the Rdata files the null distributions for Omnibus test, Stouffer test, and Fisher combination are provided for significance levels alpha=0.025 and alpha=0.05.
